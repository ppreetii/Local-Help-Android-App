# Local-Help-Android-App

**Problem Definition:**
This problem arouse during my time in home due to covid-19 pandemic. My father was searching for helping hand for his shop, and my mother was looking for housemaid in general. Besides, I have seen them finding it difficult to find electrician or plumber. So in short, I tried to bring together people to find good service as well as help the utility servers with some good earnings in this falling economy. 

This application has two parts as follows. One person can interact with only part only at time:
•	Part 1: Jobseeker- There will be designated 2-5 people who will be responsible for creating profiles of the people who are looking jobs like daily labourer, cleaning, housemaid, cook etc, and also utility workers like electrician, mechanic, plumber etc. This method was chosen with assumption that major of the jobseekers are less educated.
•	Part 2:Hirer- This is for general public who wants the service of this people. They can go through the list to find match for their needs.
